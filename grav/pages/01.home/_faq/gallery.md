# XMPP
**I forgot my password or passphrase. Can this be reset?**
It is possible to reset. During web registration users can optionally enter an email address that will be used in the account vCard. You can always add or edit the email address found in the account vCard even if this was not specified during registration. Those requesting a password reset will be required to prove account ownership, so contacting staff from the email address found in the user's vCard can possibly help with a temporary password reset that can then be updated with most XMPP/Jabber clients.

**How long are inactive accounts kept?**
Inactive user accounts are removed after 6 months.

**Why does my new account already show someone in my buddy list?**
New JID accounts will see a Support Contact in the roster list, but it is not required to have. This user can be removed or re-added at any time.

**How are user credentials protected?**
User account credentials are [hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) and [salted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)). 

**What is the minimum amount of characters a password or passphrase must be?**
 8 characters.
