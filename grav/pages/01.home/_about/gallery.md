_This Messaging Server is a secure public XMPP Jabber Service with support for MUC (Multi-User Chat), Groups, Privacy Lists, Offline Storage, vCards, Compression, File Transfer capabilities and [more](/docs/xep). This server is listed on [list.jabber.at](https://list.jabber.at/) and the [XMPP Server Directory](https://xmpp.net/directory.php). KodeNet is based out of Fremont, California - an innovative city in Silicon Valley._

KodeNet provides Jabber account services for the XMPP communications protocol. SSL/TLS encryption is [required](https://github.com/stpeter/manifesto/blob/master/manifesto.txt) between clients and servers (C2S) and server to server (S2S) connections. For increased security enable [Off-The-Record](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) in your chat client to have fully encrypted chats. Check out the [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html) for a list of XMPP clients.
