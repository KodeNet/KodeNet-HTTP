<em>This Messaging network is a free and secure public XMPP/Jabber service with support for Cloud Push Notifications, Blocking, File Transfers, HTTP File Uploads, Invite URLs, Message Archive Management, Multi-User Chat, Offline Storage, vCards with Avatars and [more](https://docs.koderoot.net/xep/modules). This server is listed on [list.jabber.at](https://list.jabber.at/) and the [XMPP Server Directory](https://xmpp.net/directory.php). See this network's <a href="https://conversations.im/compliance/" target="_blank">XMPP Compliance results</a>. KodeNet is based out of Fremont, California - an innovative city in Silicon Valley.</em>

KodeNet provides Jabber accounts for the XMPP communications protocol and keeps your conversations synchronized across all clients and devices. SSL/TLS encryption is <a href="https://github.com/stpeter/manifesto/blob/master/manifesto.txt" target="_blank" alt="SSL/TLS required">required</a> between clients and servers (C2S) and server to server (S2S) connections. For increased security enable <a href="https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/" target="_blank">Off-The-Record</a> in your chat client to have fully encrypted chats. Check out the <a href="https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html" target="_blank">XMPP Standards Foundation</a> for a list of XMPP clients.

>OMEMO is an open standard encryption protocol that not only gives you better encryption features than OpenPGP and OTR but is also much easier to setup. OMEMO lets you send encrypted messages to someone who is currently offline, uses multiple clients and simultaneously receive a copy of that message on all of your devices. Turn it on once and forget you ever did.

KodeNet supports <a href="https://conversations.im/omemo/" target="_blank" alt="OMEMO">OMEMO</a> - the world's most advanced secure multi-client end-to-end encryption.
